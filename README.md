Antheos Protocol

Antheos is a groundbreaking universal protocol poised to revolutionize computing—eliminating
operating systems and weaving user anonymity into its fabric. Built for a decentralized future,
it unites devices and software objects as a pantheon of self-governing peers, each mastering
its own resources and linked by a secure, seamless framework. No central hold, no exposed
identities—just a fearless, efficient system set to ignite an open-source rebellion and power
enterprise innovation. From audacious developers to pioneering creators of hardware and code,
Antheos ushers in a bold new age of liberated technology.
